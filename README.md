# Cyclistic bike share analysis case study 
This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

### 1. Objective (Ask Phase)
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

### 2. Prepare Phase

For this case study I chose 12 data files containing trip data gathered during each month of 2022. Data has been downloaded from Motivate International Inc. Local copies have been stored securely on Google Drive and here on Kaggle. Data can be found here https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
It was organised by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation. 

### 3. Process Phase
To organise and manage data R studio was chosen as the main tool. After regularising and importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. A new column for trip length (in minutes) was created. Any data that was unnecessary was removed. Each step of the process can be found here: docs/Bike data.Rmd

### 4. Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

### 5. Share Phase
Visualisations were created using R also. You can find them here "Cyclistic visualizations .pptx"

### 6. Act Phase
Recommendations for the marketing team based on analysis and data visualizations can be found here "Cyclistic visualizations .pptx"
