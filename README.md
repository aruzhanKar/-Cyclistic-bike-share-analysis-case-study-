### 1. Objective (Ask Phase)
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

### 2. Prepare Phase

For this case study I chose 12 data files containing trip data gathered during each month of 2022. Data has been downloaded from Motivate International Inc. Local copies have been stored securely on Google Drive and here on Kaggle. Data can be found here https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
It was organised by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation. 

### 3. Process Phase
After regularising and importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. A new column for trip length (in minutes) was created. Any data that was unnecessary was removed. A full description of the process is described here: __________
